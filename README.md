# About Me
My name is Marcus Johnson. I am 26 years old and a WSU, Stack Education student training to become a junior software engineer and web developer. I am currently employed as a Building Engineer for a property management company but am excited to take the leap into the world of tech. I have an affinity for technology and am incredibly eager to learn, work hard and hone coding skills that I'll be able to apply in my future.
